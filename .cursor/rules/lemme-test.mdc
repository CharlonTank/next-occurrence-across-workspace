CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT: 
1. ALWAYS test changes before committing/pushing
2. NEVER commit or push without my explicit approval
3. For testing:
   a. First run: npm run compile
   b. Then run: code --new-window --extensionDevelopmentPath=$(pwd) ../tmp/yo
   <<<<<c. WAIT for my confirmation that it works >>>>> THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
4. ONLY AFTER I explicitly confirm the test works, proceed with Readme modifications, git operations and publication.
