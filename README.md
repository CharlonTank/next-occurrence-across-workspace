> 🚀 **Quickly navigate through all occurrences of selected text across your entire workspace**

Ever wanted to jump between all instances of a variable, function, or text pattern across your entire project? This extension makes it simple and fast!

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 Jump to the **next occurrence** of selected text with `Alt+F`
- 🔍 Jump to the **previous occurrence** with `Alt+Shift+F`
- 📊 See match statistics in the status bar (e.g., "Match 3/12 for 'myFunction'")
- 🔄 Cycle through occurrences automatically - when you reach the end, it loops back to the beginning
- ⚙️ Configure directories to exclude from search
- 🔤 Case-insensitive search across all files

## 📋 How to Use

1. **Select** any text in your editor

   ```js
   const myVariable = "Hello World";
   ```

2. Press `Alt+F` to find the next occurrence or `Alt+Shift+F` for the previous one

3. The extension will:
   - Find all matching occurrences across your entire workspace
   - Show a status indicator with the total number of matches
   - Navigate to the next/previous occurrence

4. Keep pressing the shortcuts to navigate through all matches

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the extension's behavior through VS Code settings:

### Accessing Settings

You can access settings in multiple ways:

1. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the extension view
2. Click the gear icon in the status bar when using the extension
3. Use the command palette: `Next Occurrence Across Workspace: Open Settings`
4. Go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Next Occurrence"

### Exclude Patterns

Specify directories to exclude from search using glob patterns:

```json
"nextOccurenceAcrossWorkspace.excludePatterns": [
  "**/node_modules/**",
  "**/dist/**",
  "**/out/**",
  "**/.git/**",
  "**/bower_components/**",
  "**/build/**",
  "**/.next/**",
  "**/.vscode/**"
]
```

### Hidden Files

Control whether to include hidden files in the search:

```json
"nextOccurenceAcrossWorkspace.includeHiddenFiles": false
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- VS Code 1.95.0 or higher

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Find next occurrence | `Alt+F` |
| Find previous occurrence | `Alt+Shift+F` |

You can customize these in your keybindings.json file:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "alt+f",
    "command": "next-occurence-across-workspace.findNextOccurrence",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "alt+shift+f",
    "command": "next-occurence-across-workspace.findPreviousOccurrence",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  }
]
```

## 💡 Tips

- Works seamlessly with code, comments, strings, and any text content
- Great for refactoring when you need to check all instances of a function or variable
- Use it to navigate through code patterns or repeated text

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- The search may take longer in large workspaces with many files
