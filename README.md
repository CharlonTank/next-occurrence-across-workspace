## ‚ú® Features

- üîç Jump to the **previous occurrence** with `Alt+Shift+F`
- üìä See match statistics in the status bar (e.g., "Match 3/12 for 'myFunction'")
- üîÑ Cycle through occurrences automatically - when you reach the end, it loops back to the beginning
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configure directories to exclude from search
- üî§ Case-insensitive search across all files

## üìã How to Use

   ```

2. Press `Alt+F` to find the next occurrence or `Alt+Shift+F` for the previous one

3. The extension will:
   - Find all matching occurrences across your entire workspace
   - Show a status indicator with the total number of matches

4. Keep pressing the shortcuts to navigate through all matches
